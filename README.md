# alokhe-bot
Used discord.js v14.0 to create a bot based on [this repo](https://github.com/sheeerio/alokhe) for my hindi speaking indian friends!

The discord bot currently supports- 
- English to Hindi transliteration (for pronunciation improvement)
- Hinglish to Hindi transliteration (for fully non-english communication in servers)

## Usage Examples
- English to Hindi transliteration
  ```
  input: /transliterate kind:[English to Hindi] sentence:[sentence]
  ```
  Example sentence: Don't forget to be passionate:
  ```
  input: \transliterate kind:English to Hindi sentence:Don't forget to be passionate
  output: The transliterated sentence is डोंट फर्गैट टू बी पैशनट
  ```
- Hindi-English to Hindi transliteration
  ```
  input: /transliterate kind:[Hinglish to Hindi] sentence:[sentence]
  ```
  Example sentence: bhoola mat karo please:
  ```
  input: \transliterate kind: Hinglish to Hindi sentence:bhoola mat karo please
  output: The transliterated sentence is भूला मत करो प्लीज़
  ```
## More language-pairs will be added soon.
